PIM hosted Modula-2 R10 Bootstrap Kernel

M2BSK is a bootstrap kernel for the revised Modula-2 language by B.Kowarsch and R.Sutcliffe "Modula-2 Revision 2010", aka Modula-2 R10.

It supports the Bootstrap Kernel (BSK) subset of Modula-2 R10 and translates source written in the BSK subset to PIM Modula-2.  Its primary purpose is to facilitate bootstrapping of a self-hosting compiler that suppports the full Modula-2 R10 specification.

M2BSK is written in PIM Modula-2 and can therefore be built using any legacy compiler that supports the dialects described in the third or fourth editions of Niklaus Wirth's book "Programming in Modula-2" (PIM) published by Springer Verlag.
