(* Operations *)

(* Support for an operation depends on the mode in which the file has
 * been opened. Any attempt to carry out an unsupported operation will
 * fail with status failure.

(* Open and close *)

PROCEDURE Open
  ( VAR f : File; filename : ARRAY OF CHAR; mode : Mode; VAR s : Status );
(* Opens file filename in mode. Passes file handle in f and status in s.
   If the file does not exist, it will be created when opened in write mode,
   otherwise status failure is passed back in s.  When opening an already
   existing file in write mode, all of its current contents are replaced. *)

PROCEDURE Close ( VAR f : File; s : Status );
(* Closes file associated with file handle f. Passes status in s. *)


(* Introspection *)

PROCEDURE GetMode ( f : File; VAR m : Mode );
(* Passes the mode of file f in m. *)

PROCEDURE GetStatus ( f : File; VAR s : Status );
(* Passes the status of the last operation on file f in s. *)


(* Positioning *)

PROCEDURE GetPos ( f : File; VAR pos : LONGCARD );
(* Passes the current reading or writing position of file f in pos. *)

PROCEDURE SetPos ( f : File; pos : LONGCARD );
(* Sets the reading position of file f to pos. *)

PROCEDURE eof ( f : File ) : BOOLEAN;
(* Returns TRUE if the end of file f has been reached, otherwise FALSE. *)


(* IO operations *)

PROCEDURE ReadOctets
  ( f : File; VAR buffer : ARRAY OF OCTET; VAR octetsRead : LONGCARD );
(* Reads contents starting at the current reading position of file f into
   buffer until either buffer is full or eof is reached. The number of octets
   actually read is passed in bytesRead. *)

PROCEDURE ReadChars
  ( f : File; VAR buffer : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR charsRead : LONGCARD );
(* Reads contents starting at the current reading position of file f into
   buffer until either the pen-ultimate index of buffer is written or eof
   is reached. The buffer is then terminated with ASCII NUL. The number of
   characters actually read is passed in charsRead. *)

PROCEDURE WriteOctets
  ( f : File; buffer : ARRAY OF OCTET; VAR octetsWritten : LONGCARD );
(* Writes the contents of buffer at the current writing position to file f.
   The number of octets actually written is passed in bytesWritten. *)

PROCEDURE WriteChars
  ( f : File; buffer : ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR charsWritten : LONGCARD );
(* Writes the contents of buffer up to and excluding the first ASCII NUL
   character code at the current writing position to file f.
   The number of characters actually written is passed in charsWritten. *)
